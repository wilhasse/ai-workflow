# AI Workflow Tools

A collection of productivity tools for AI-powered development workflows.

## Projects

### 🎙️ Whisper Realtime API

FastAPI service that exposes OpenAI's Whisper model for audio transcription with GPU acceleration.

**Features:**
- Batch and streaming transcription endpoints
- Browser-based audio recorder UI
- Docker deployment with CUDA support
- Multiple model sizes (tiny to large-v3)

**Quick Start:**
```bash
cd whisper-realtime-api
docker build -t whisper-realtime-api .
docker run --rm --gpus all -p 8000:8000 whisper-realtime-api
# Open http://localhost:8000 for web UI
```

### 🖥️ Terminal Dashboard

React SPA with an embedded xterm.js client for organizing tmux-backed browser terminals across projects.

**Features:**
- Multi-project terminal organization
- Persistent session management via localStorage
- Flexible port strategies (single or sequential) to target different bridge hosts
- Deep linking, browser tab isolation, and clipboard-friendly xterm.js terminals
- Talks directly to tmux-session-service for session lifecycle + streaming I/O

**Quick Start:**
```bash
cd terminal-dashboard
npm install
npm run dev
# Open http://localhost:5173
```

### 🔄 tmux Session Service

Lightweight Node.js HTTP + WebSocket service that provisions persistent tmux sessions for the dashboard.

**Features:**
- Persistent shell sessions that survive browser reloads
- HTTP API for session lifecycle management
- Built-in WebSocket bridge that streams tmux output to xterm.js
- Automatic session creation and reattachment
- Metadata tracking and cleanup endpoints

**Quick Start:**
```bash
cd tmux-session-service
npm start
# Service runs on http://0.0.0.0:5001

# Test the WebSocket bridge (requires wscat)
npx wscat -c ws://localhost:5001/ws/sessions/dev-shell
```

## 🐳 Production Deployment with Docker

Deploy the entire AI Workflow stack with a single command using Docker Compose.

### Quick Start

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/wilhasse/ai-workflow.git
cd ai-workflow

# Start all services
docker-compose up -d

# Access the application
# Open browser to https://localhost
```

### What's Included

The Docker deployment includes:
- **nginx** - Reverse proxy with SSL termination + WebSocket upgrades
- **terminal-dashboard** - React frontend with embedded terminals
- **tmux-session-service** - Session persistence API + WebSocket bridge
- **whisper-realtime-api** (optional) - Voice transcription

### Deepgram Voice

The mobile terminal can use Deepgram through `tmux-session-service`, so the browser never receives the API key.

Set these in a local `.env` or deployment environment before restarting Compose:

```bash
DEEPGRAM_API_KEY=...
DEEPGRAM_STT_MODEL=nova-3
DEEPGRAM_STT_LANGUAGE=pt-BR
DEEPGRAM_TTS_MODEL=aura-2-thalia-en
DEEPGRAM_TTS_ENCODING=mp3
```

Mobile voice input posts recorded audio to `/api/voice/transcribe`. The `/mobile` terminal also has a `Read` control that captures recent terminal output and plays it through `/api/voice/tts`.

### Tmux Tab Labels

The desktop dashboard has an `Organize` view for app-only tmux window labels. Labels are stored in the shared launcher state at `~/.local/state/ai-workflow/workspace-v2.json`, show in Ctrl+Enter switchers and `/mobile`, and do not rename the real tmux windows.

### Architecture

```
Internet → nginx (443) ─→ terminal-dashboard (React + xterm)
                      └→ tmux-session-service (API + WebSocket)
```

### Services

| Service | Container Port | External Port | Purpose |
|---------|---------------|---------------|---------|
| nginx | 80, 443 | 80, 443 | Reverse proxy, SSL |
| terminal-dashboard | 3000 | via nginx | React frontend |
| tmux-session-service | 5001 | proxied via nginx | Session API + terminal bridge |

## Development

Each project is independent with its own dependencies and build system. See [CLAUDE.md](CLAUDE.md) for comprehensive development guidelines.

### Development vs Production

**Development** (manual setup):
- Run each service independently
- Vite dev server for hot reload
- Direct process management

**Production** (Docker Compose):
- All services containerized
- nginx reverse proxy
- Automatic restarts and health checks
- Production-optimized builds
